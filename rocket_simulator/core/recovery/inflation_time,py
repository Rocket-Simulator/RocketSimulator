*@ filling time is the time interval elapsed between line stretch and the moment when the canopy reaches 
   its designed steadyand the moment when the canopy reaches its designed steady state
*@ stretch speed is the speed of the payload when it reaches the steady state
*@ nominal diameter is designed by the diameter of the canopy (4So/pi)^1/2 or the equivalent diameter in case of non hemispherical parachutes
