*Example of data in 'propellants' folder*

## Utils üìù

In 'utils', we have important content simulation, like archives which contain classes for grouping related data, like parachute, nose type, rocket parts
data. We also have codes with fundamental constants needed and wind information for simulation.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205337747-80985d27-a945-499e-a02b-516676f5e25f.png)

</p>

Physics is a very important folder for the project, being responsible for bringing together most of the variables and functions that operate basic physics, or classical mechanics as it is commonly called. This section holds the programming that deals with the forces applied to the rocket, as well as vectors, which orient the forces and their direction, torque, coordinates, and more.

### forces

The folder that contains all the forces applied to the rocket through its trajectory, such as: drag, weight and wind force. All classes in this folder inherit from the **Vector** class, so they will all be treated as vectors, having their methods, as they should be.

*delta_time_simulation:*
<p>It contains the DeltaTimeSimulation class, which represents the state of the rocket at a given time. Its only use is to get this information
information in a practical way.</p>

### resultant_force

This file contains the ResultantForce class, responsible for receiving a list of forces and using them to calculate the resultant force at the indicated time "t". The list of forces MUST be ordered with the least dependent forces coming first, as changing the order can change the final result, with forces being calculated without having their dependent forces calculated properly. The change attenuates by decreasing *DELTA_TIME_SIMULATION*.

~~~python
class ResultantForce(Force):
    def __init__(self, forces: List[Force]):
        self.__forces = forces 
        # List of forces that MUST be ordered from most independent to least independent
        super().__init__(0, 0, 0, ApplicationPoint.CG)
~~~

Still within the class, we have the method that effectively performs the calculation of the resultant force, respecting all the peculiarities and dependencies of the other related forces.

~~~python
# Args: 'current_state: DeltaTimeSimulation' = Current state of the rocket.
def calculate(self, current_state: DeltaTimeSimulation):
        # Following the order of dependency of forces
        for force in self.__forces: 
            force.calculate(current_state)

        resultant_force = Vector(0, 0, 0)
        for force in self.__forces:
            resultant_force += force

        # Defines the resultant forces in each of the directions
        self.setX(resultant_force.x())
        self.setY(resultant_force.y())
        self.setZ(resultant_force.z())
~~~

### resultant_torque

This file contains the ResultantTorque class, responsible for receiving a list of torques and using them to calculate the resultant torque at the indicated time "t". The list of torques MUST be ordered with the least dependent torques coming first, as changing the order can change the final result, with torques being calculated without having their dependent torques calculated properly. The change attenuates by decreasing *DELTA_TIME_SIMULATION*.

~~~python
class ResultantTorque(Vector):
    def __init__(self, forces: List[Force], additional_torques=[]):
        self.__forces = forces
        self.__additional_torques = additional_torques
        # List of torques that MUST be ordered from most independent to least independent
        super().__init__(0, 0, 0)
~~~

Still within the class, we have the method that effectively performs the calculation of the resultant torque, respecting all the peculiarities and dependencies of the other related torques.

~~~python
# Args: 'current_state: DeltaTimeSimulation' = Current state of the rocket.
def calculate(self, current_state: DeltaTimeSimulation):
        # Following the order of dependency of forces
        for force in self.__forces:
            force.calculate(current_state)

        resultant_torque = Vector(0, 0, 0)
        for force in self.__forces:
            if force.application_point == ApplicationPoint.CG:
                continue
            
            lever = current_state.cg - current_state.cp
            torque = Vector.crossProduct(force, lever)
            resultant_torque += torque

        for torque in self.__additional_torques:
            torque.calculate(current_state)
            resultant_torque += torque

        # Defines the resultant torque in each of the directions
        self.setX(resultant_torque.x())
        self.setY(resultant_torque.y())
        self.setZ(resultant_torque.z())
~~~

### vector

## Aerodynamic üí®

Aerodynamic deals with the result of the interaction of the air and a rigid body during the occurrence of a flow between them. It is, for obvious reasons,
indispensable for a model rocket project, once it influences hardly on its stability, apogee, trajectory and other parameters. Next, we describe briefly some of
the files restrained in this folder.

### 1. *Angular velocity* code

This file calculates the angular velocity of the model. Using the velocity of the rocket and its angle of attack, it multiplies the first by the sin() of the
second, which returns  the angular velocity.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205468607-17e3008e-7d16-4fde-8293-d3c7b9536fe9.png)

*Angular velocity calculus*

### 2. *CP of one body component* code

Through this code, we're able to estimate the center of pressure of each component of the rocket seperately. It receives the base area, the top area, the component
volume and its length to calculate this coordinate.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205468808-b5134961-dd94-41b4-981d-1963ac27862e.png)

*CP of one component function*

### 3. *Critical Reynolds number* code

Using the functions contained in this archive, the simulator is able to calculate the expected critical Reynolds number through the material roughness and the
rocket length. This parameter is important for us to understand the behavior of the model in an air flow.

### 4. *Fin drag* code

The code in this file considers that the air flow is perpendicular to the fin chord and, by this mean, calculates the fin drag in function of the mach number
of the rocket.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205469113-fa4a8cfe-8934-48d7-a106-fc84dbff6d8f.png)

*Fin drag code snippet*

### 5. *Lift effect* code

By manipulating the parameters of cilinder length, cilinder diameter, reference area and angle of attack, this code returns us the  normal force coefficient.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205469251-d7b28b2e-3586-4b26-8639-a42d9767ea3d.png)

*Lift effect code*

### 6. *Mach Number* code

A simple method to return the mach number, important for the calculations ahead, using the velocity of the rocket divided by the local sound velocity.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92520893/205469116-3ea97332-1964-4c54-a941-74c268e58308.png">

### 7. *Nose Pressure Drag* code

If the transition batween the body of the rocket and the nose is smooth, the nose pressure drag coefficient is equal to zero. But if the transition has a conical shape, "bodynoseAngle" will be an argument used to calculate the pressure drag on the nose.

### 8. *Reynoulds Number* code

Reynolds number is used to determine the type of flow pattern as laminar or turbulent while flowing through a pipe, and it's calculated by the **reynolds_number** method. It's a simple file in the project, but very important.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92520893/205469174-2e62b19e-66b9-4380-9916-ecaf6dd3eafa.png">

### 9. *Skin Friction* code

This file will return the drag coefficient according to the mach number, using the reynolds number, and will not be able to do so if the rocket is supersonic.

### 10. *Total Skin Friction Drag Coefficient* code

Finally, using the drag coefficient collected with the work of the two programs above, this method will return the total friction drag coefficient applied on the full body of the rocket.

## Structure üß±

The Structure folder holds codes for the calculus of diverse tension and stress types, as well as of information got from the input dimensions of the

+**'internal_radius'**
+**'vessel_maximum_pressure'**
+**'von_Mises_stress'**

Outputs:

The manners to calculate the 'parameter a' are shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205346674-7cdf4c3e-b032-44c7-82db-42ae27ae9daf.png)

*Code for calculus of parameter a.*

### 2. *Thin walls check* code

Inputs:

+ **'external_radius'**
+**'internal_radius'**

Outputs:

This technical feature will be important for some following calculus and is determined this way:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205354985-0f1eefdf-2225-4bfc-b759-3568199f8080.png)

### 3. *Circumferential tension* code

Inputs:

+ **'parameter_a'**: the relation between motor external and internal radius.
+ **'vessel_maximum_pressure'**: maximum pressure inside motor due to ignition of fuel grain.

Outputs:

This code calculates the circumferetial tension expected to act on motor thin walls.

### 4. *External radius* code

Inputs:

+ **'parameter_a'**

+ **'vessel_maximum_pressure'**

Outputs:

+ **'longitudinal_tension'**: the longitudinal tension that will act on motor thin walls.

This parameter is important to know if the motor walls will resist the tension applied to it, and it is calculated with the following
expression:

$VMP / (2*(a - 1))$

*VMP: 'Vessel Maximum Pressure'*

### 6. *Radial tension* code

Inputs:

+ **'parameter_a'**
+ **'vessel_maximum_pressure'**

Outputs:

With a thin walls motor, this function always returns 0.

### 7. *Von Mises stresss* code

Inputs:

For this calculus, the safety margin is not a necessary input. Once the safety margin depends on Von Mises stress for being calculated, the
Von Mises Stress will be recalculated after obtaining the safety margin. Said that, this parameter is acquired this way:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205353417-75907c1f-12d4-4e3c-816e-9c52e512e312.png)

*Von Mises stress calculus*

### 8. *Safety margin* code

Inputs:

+ **'von_Mises_stress'**
+ **'material'**

The safety margin is important to ensure that the motor will resist the Von Mises stress. It is calculated as in the next picture:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119083049/205365465-fa6fc29d-c934-4e6b-b135-8a4dd89e27c1.png)

*Safety margin calculus*

### 9. *Thickness* code

+ **'external_radius'**
+**'internal_radius'**

With all these methods, we're able to determine a lot of important things for simulation and for checking rocket properties.

## Simulation üñ•Ô∏è

This file creates a superclass for the other ambients needed. It receives a list of forces for the construction of the ambient.

### 2. *Airless earth ambient* code

It generates a subclass of AbstractAmbient which comprehends an environment of an airless earth and uses the *'physics'* codes.

*Airless earth code*

### 3. *Earth ambient* code

Just as the other classes, this is a subclass of AbstractAmbient. It is similar to the previous file, but this Earth has a 'little' difference:
it has atmosphere.

*Airfull Earth code*

### 4. *Simulation* code

This is the most extensive code of this folder and is responsible for the simulation itself. in the 'simulation' class, it coordinates the physics
simulation. This class has a lot of especial functions that will be briefly described in the ensuing table:

| Method                          | What it does                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| setupForces()                   | adds the forces involved in the simulation                                               |
| tryEjection()                   | verifies periodically if the parachute must be ejected in that moment and tries to do so |
| __correctParachuteOrientation() | after ejection, it corrects rocket's orientation to (0,0,1)                              |
| simulate()                      | runs the simulation for a specified range time and using a defined time interval         |
| __applyResultantForce()         | applies the resultant force on the body                                                  |
| __applyResultantTorque()        | calculates and applies the resultant torque on the body                                  |

With this part of the code, we're able to simulate properly, as we wanted.
